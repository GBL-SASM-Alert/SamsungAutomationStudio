# @d5mi/node-red-contrib-object-detection

This module provides nodes of Node-RED for recognizing objects with a camera, determining and recording interactions between users and objects.

Use TensoFlow's COCO-SSD model to detect objects defined in the COCO dataset, which is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset.

In this module, there is an object detection node that uses the camera to determine what the object in the video is.

And, object person determine node determined which objects the user was interacting with through logic to determine which of the recognized objects was closest to the user.

These nodes work reliably Node.js version 16.17.0 and Node-RED 3.0.2.

## Node

- [object-detection](https://github.com/D5MI/node-red-contrib-object-detection/tree/master/object_detection): A node that detect various objects, determine the interactions between a user and objects, and record logs.
- [object-person-determine](https://github.com/D5MI/node-red-contrib-object-detection/tree/master/object-person-determine): A node that determines which of the detected objects most interacts with the user.
- [object-detection-log](https://github.com/D5MI/node-red-contrib-object-detection/tree/master/object-detection-log): This node records the detected motion poses and objects and saves them to a file. The files are saved in the entered storage location by date named log-yyyy-MM-dd.
- [object-detection-iot](https://github.com/D5MI/node-red-contrib-object-detection/tree/master/object-detection-iot): A node that detect various objects, determine the interactions between a user and objects, and record logs.

## Pre-requisites

This module requires [Node-RED](https://nodered.org/) to be installed.

<br>

## Install

To install the stable version use the `Menu - Manage palette` option and search for `@d5mi/node-red-contrib-object-detection`, or run the following command in your Node-RED user directory - typically `~/.node-red`:

```bash
npm i @d5mi/node-red-contrib-object-detection
```
